# weather-dashboard

In this project, I have built a functional weather dashboard app. It will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. Powering the functionality of this app is a third party API known as OpenWeather API. This API allows me to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to the URL.

## Upon opening the application:

You will search a city and then will be presented with current and future conditions for that city.
WHEN you view the current weather conditions for that city
THEN you will be presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity,
the wind speed, and the UV index. 
WHEN you view the UV index, you will be presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
WHEN you view future weather conditions for that city, THEN  you will be presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.
