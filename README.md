# weather-dashboard

In this project, I have built a functional weather dashboard app. It will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. Powering the functionality of this app is a third party API known as OpenWeather API. This API allows me to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to the URL.
